Escape Documentation
====================

This repository contains (most of the) documentation for Escape and the Escape
Inventory. It contains the introduction, quickstart and reference
documentation, and it also generates the downloads page.

The reference documentation is copied from the
[escape-core](https://github.com/ankyra/escape-core) and
[escape](https://github.com/ankyra/escape) releases, which generate these pages
from their golang structs in their build phase.

The build requires a working `hugulp` and `hugo` installation.

Note for non-Ankyra people: you can't currently use `escape` to build this
release as we haven't open sourced all the required pieces yet, but `hugulp`
should work.
