# Installation

The following instructions assume 64 bit machines, which is probably what you need, 
but you can find 32 bit builds on the [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

## Linux

```
curl https://
tar -xvzf 
sudo mv escape /usr/bin/escape
```

## MacOS

```
curl https://
tar -xvzf 
sudo mv escape /usr/bin/escape
```

# The Escape Plan

At its core Escape provides abstractions to work with _units of deployments_. A
_unit of deployment_ is a collection of files, plus a bit of metadata to tell
Escape what it can do. Based on the metadata Escape knows how to build, test,
deploy, destroy and operate the unit.

Metadata doesn't have to be written by hand, but can be compiled from an
_Escape plan_. The smallest Escape plan looks like this:

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 1.0
```

(Pro-tip: A documented, but otherwise fairly similar Escape plan, can be
generated by running `escape plan init -n my-deployment-unit`. You can also
format existing plans in this manner by running `escape plan fmt`)

# Versioning

## Auto-versioning

It's a bit annoying to have to change the version field every time you do a
build, but at the same time having immutable releases is valuable. Wouldn't it
be nice if we could automatically pick a new version? Yes.

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 1.0.@
build: build_my_thing.sh
```

This will first build `1.0.0`, but once that's been released it will take
`1.0.1`, `1.0.2`, `1.0.3`, ...  If we want to work on a new minor version, we
can change the field manually to:

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 1.1.@
build: build_my_thing.sh
```

And then the next version will be `1.1.0`, `1.1.1`, ... Following such a scheme
strikes a reasonable balance between having meaningful versions vs. manual
intervention.

# State

## Inputs and outputs

A string input

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
inputs:
- my_variable
```

Or in the longer form:

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
inputs:
- id: my_variable
  type: string
```

We can also specify the types `integer`, `bool` and `list`.

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
inputs:
- id: my_variable
  type: bool
  default: true
  description: "Is this a boolean?"
  friendly: "My Variable"
```

We can tell it to pick a value out of a list:

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
inputs:
- id: my_variable
  type: string
  items:
  - choice number 1
  - choice number 2
```

And calculate a default value:


## State management

# Errands

# Composing Units

## Dependencies

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
depends:
- stdlib-latest
```

A unit can use its dependencies' outputs as its own inputs.

## Providers and Consumers


```
name: my-project/my-provider
version: 0.0.@
provides:
- a-provider

outputs:
- id: test_output
  default: hello world
```

```
name: my-project/my-consumer
version: 0.0.@
consumes:
- a-provider

inputs:
- id: test_input
  default: $a-provider.outputs.test_output
```

## Extensions

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 0.0.@
extends:
- extension-docker-latest
```
